# Gas-Price-And-Urbanization
In this project, I analysed the relation between gas price and urbanisation rate of many countries around the world.

This project was done by group, but I am responsible for coding and analyzing.

This project was instructed by Prof. Laurie CIARAMELLA, Telecom Paris.

## Introduction
Oil has been fuelling the economic growth of the XXth century, but is now
largely looked down upon because of the consequence its use has over global
warming. Yet, oil is still pumped in vast quantities, and it is still referred to as the
black gold. Its actual price, once refined, varies a lot from one country to another,
meaning that people all over the globe don’t have the same ability to buy petrol, and
therefore to drive their car.

Indeed, the cheaper the petrol, the cheaper the cost of transportation by car.
In Venezuela on the one hand, a liter of gasoline costs 0.020 U.S. Dollar, while on
the other hand, in Hong Kong, this same liter costs 2.442 U.S. Dollars. These were
the two extremal prices on March, 29th 2021, yet they shed light on the considerable
disparity that exists between countries at a worldwide scale.

Another thing that tends to vary drastically from a country to another is the
part of the population living in urban areas. The human population worldwide has
been steeply growing since the dawn of humanity, and since 2007, more than half of
the world population is living in cities. It is predicted that by 2050 about 64% of the
developing world and 86% of the developed world will be urbanized.

Therefore, urbanization is at the core of the social development of the
upcoming years. It is relatively obvious that people living in more sparsely populated
areas might tend to drive around the lot more than the ones living in urban areas,
where one can find anything he might need to live in a 10-kilometer radius. This is
the reason why in our project we wanted to investigate the possible correlation
existing between the oil price in a country, and the urbanization in the same country.

In order to conduct our project, we first had to find suitable datasets, which
wasn’t as easy as expected, yet we ended up finding enough data to lead our study.
The countries we focused on are the United States of America, Canada, the United
Kingdom and France. Although all these countries are relatively close when it comes
to economic development, they were the ones with the most data available, and we
believe that a panel of data, ranging from 1992 to 2019, is appropriate for us to try to
shed a light on an hypothetical correlation, at least in the aforementioned countries,
between the price of petrol and the level of urbanization.

**This project was composed by two courses MODS206 and MODS207. On MODS206, I started the early stage of the project, then on MODS207, I went deeper in the sults and analysis. Please read the PDF report for MODS206, and Slides for MODS207 for more explaination.**
